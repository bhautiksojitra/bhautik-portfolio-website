My passion for computer science sparked in high school at a coding bootcamp focused on C programming. Each day we were given new problems to solve using core C concepts. I noticed myself coming up with solutions easily compared to other more experienced peers. This experience motivated me to pursue computer scinece as a long-term career. <br/><br/>

I graduated in 2024 with a Bachelor of Computer Science (First Class Honours) from the University of Manitoba. Throughout my studies, I developed strong skills in core concepts and enjoyed courses like Computer Graphics, Networks and Security, and Theoretical Computer Science. I learned many languages and technologies such as C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, SQL, OpenGL, OpenMP, and more. Overall, my five years at the University of Manitoba have been incredibly rewarding. <br/><br/>

So far, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working with a research organization, a large ag-tech corporation, and the computer science department at my university. In most parts of these jobs, my focus has been on implementing software solutions that solve problems and improve user experiences. <br/><br/>
